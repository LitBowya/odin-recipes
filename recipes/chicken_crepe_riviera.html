    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These mouthwatering crepes are stuffed with vinegar-marinated chicken and topped with a luxurious mixture of
        heavy cream, pesto, and portobello mushrooms.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>6 leaves fresh basil leaves, minced</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds chicken tenderloins, diced</li>
        <li>¼ cup grapeseed oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 head broccoli, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 Roma tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>½ (8 ounce) package sliced portobello mushrooms (Optional)</li>
        <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons semi-soft cheese with garlic and herbs (such as Allouette®)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pesto</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine milk, flour, and eggs in a blender. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Brush hot pan with a small amount of butter. Ladle about 3
            tablespoons of batter into the center of the pan. Tilt pan from left to right to cover entire surface.
            Sprinkle top of the crepe with 1 or 2 teaspoons of basil.</li>
        <li>Cook until edges begin to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip crepe over and cook until set, about 2 minutes more.
            Remove to a plate. Cook remaining batter, re-brushing pan with butter and stacking crepes with parchment
            paper in between.</li>
        <li>Mix chicken, grapeseed oil, balsamic vinegar, and salt together in a resealable zip-top bag; marinate for 20
            to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain and discard marinade. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook and stir until juices
            run clear, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place broccoli in a microwave-safe bowl with 2 tablespoons water. Microwave until crisp-tender, 3 to 4
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine butter and garlic in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the
            broccoli; stir to coat with the garlic butter. Stir in tomatoes and mushrooms and heat through.</li>
        <li>Stir cream, cheese, and pesto together in a separate saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until sauce
            comes together, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lay a crepe on a plate, line chicken filling down the middle, and drizzle sauce on top. Fold crepe over
            burrito-style; spoon more chicken and sauce over top. Repeat with remaining crepes, filling, and sauce.</li>
    </ol>
